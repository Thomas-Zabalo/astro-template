## Usage of MDX

MDX is used in Eclipse for creating dynamic content. MDX allows you to write JSX in Markdown documents, making it easy to embed React components alongside Markdown content. Here's how MDX is used:

- **Create MDX files** in the `/src/pages` or `/src/content/*` directories.
- Use Markdown syntax for text formatting.
- Embed React components directly within the Markdown content for interactive elements.
