## Separating Files by Language

Create folders for each language under `pages` and add files in Astro or Markdown format.

```text
src/pages
├── en/
│   └── page-1.astro
│   └── page-2.mdx
└── ja/
  └── page-1.astro
  └── page-2.mdx
```

The following pages will be generated:

* /en/page-1/index.html
* /en/page-2/index.html
* /ja/page-1/index.html
* /ja/page-2/index.html


## Managing in a Single File

If the amount of page content is not too large, you can use Astro's dynamic routing feature to generate pages for each language dynamically from a single file.

```text
src/pages
└── [lang]/
    └── page-1.astro
    └── page-2.astro
```

Import the `LOCALES` object in the file and generate dynamic routes using Astro's `getStaticPaths()` function.

```astro
---
import { LOCALES } from "@/i18n";

export const getStaticPaths = () =>
  Object.keys(LOCALES).map((lang) => ({
    params: { lang },
  }));
---
```

The following pages will be generated:

* /en/page-1/index.html
* /en/page-2/index.html
* /ja/page-1/index.html
* /ja/page-2/index.html

## Using Content Collection

If you want to manage pages like blogs or news using Markdown files, you can use Astro's Content Collection feature.

#### Directory

```text
src/
├── content/
│   ├── config.ts
│   ├── blog/en/
│   │   └── first-post.md
│   │   └── second-post.md
│   └── blog/ja/
│        └── first-post.md
│        └── second-post.md
└── pages/[lang]/blog/
  └── index.astro
  └── [...slug].astro
```

#### pages/[lang]/blog/[...slug].astro

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Article.astro";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection("blog");

  return posts.map((post) => {
    const [lang, ...slug] = post.slug.split("/");
    return { params: { lang, slug: slug.join("/") || undefined }, props: post };
  });
}
---
```


Please refer to the Astro documentation for more details.

### LocaleSelect.astro
A select UI for switching between languages.

### LocaleSelectSingle.astro
A link UI to another language. Use this when you only support two languages.

### LocalesHomeList.astro
Returns a list of links to the top pages of each language, wrapped in `<li>` tags.

### LocaleSuggest.astro
Displays a UI at the top suggesting a link to the browser's language when the user accesses a URL different from their browser's language.

For example, if a user with English settings accesses the URL `/ja/[slug]`, it suggests a link to `/en/[slug]`.

Once closed, the setting is saved on localhost and will not be displayed again.

### LocaleHtmlHead.astro
Allows you to specify `<head>` tag settings for each locale. The sample code loads the [Noto Font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for each language and applies the CSS.

### NotTranslateCaution.astro
Displays a warning to the user when a specific page is only available in a certain language.

The sample page is [Monolingual](/monolingual/). When this page is viewed in a language other than English, it displays a warning UI to the user.

The text for the warning UI is set in `/src/const.ts` in the sample code.



## 404

The { SITE_TITLE } 404 page consists of two files. If you want to customize the design of the 404 page, you generally only need to edit `src/pages/[lang]/404.astro`.

### src/pages/404.astro

This file generates the following:

> /404.html

Most deploy services will find and use this file when a page is not found.

When accessed with { SITE_TITLE }, it redirects to the following 404 page based on the user's system language:

<details>
    <summary>Detailed Redirect Conditions</summary>
    The redirect is performed based on the following conditions. For more details, please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/psephopaiktes/astro-i18n-starter/blob/main/src/pages/404.astro#L25).

    1. If the URL contains `/ja/...` or any other language code.
    2. If the `localStorage.selectedLang` contains the language code.
        * The `localStorage.selectedLang` is saved when the user selects a language in the UI.
    3. If the referring page contains `/ja/...` or any other language code.
</details>

### src/pages/[lang]/404.astro

This file dynamically generates the following:

> * /en/404/index.html
> * /ja/404/index.html
> * ...

Actually, by `history.replaceState()` process displays the URL the user accessed before the redirect in the browser


## CSS Tips

### Separating CSS for each language

You can separate the definitions using CSS alone by writing as follows:

```css
:lang(en) {
    /* Styles for English */
}
:lang(ar) {
    /* Styles for Arabic */
}
```

However, in this case, all language CSS will be loaded simultaneously, resulting in wasted resources.

If you are writing inside `.astro` files, consider writing as follows or separating the definitions within [LocaleHtmlHead.astro](#localehtmlheadastro).

```astro
---
import { type Lang } from "@/i18n";
const locale = Astro.currentLocale as Lang;
---

{
    locale === "en" ? (
        <style>
            /* Styles for English */
        </style>
    )
    : locale === "ar" ? (
        <style>
            /* Styles for Arabic */
        </style>
    )
    : null
}
```


### Letter-spacing for Arabic

In some designs, you may want to adjust the letter-spacing for headings and other elements. However, it is important not to add spacing for Arabic text.

> [Right-to-left Styling](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling#1.-letter-spacing)

Therefore, please note that { SITE_TITLE } defines the following in `src/styles/base.css`:

```css
:lang(ar) {
    * { letter-spacing: 0 !important; }
}
```


### RTL Icons

In RTL languages, icons such as arrows need to be mirrored.

> [Right to left | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left#Interface-icons)

{ SITE_TITLE } uses [Material Icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons), and the following is defined in `src/styles/base.css`:

```css
[class^="material-icons"]:dir(rtl).dir {
    scale: -1 1;
}
```

By adding the `.dir` class, the icons will be mirrored in RTL languages.

```html
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">arrow_forward</span>
```

Actual display: 
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">arrow_forward</span>
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">open_in_new</span>
